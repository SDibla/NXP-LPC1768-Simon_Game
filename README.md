# NXP-LPC1768-Simon_Game

Emulate the Simone Game using 3 buttons to repeat the sequence displayed by the system using 3 leds (Random generation).  In the case of correct sequence the game repeats, increasing by 1 the length of the sequence. Otherwise the player loses, and the game starts again from sequence length 1.
